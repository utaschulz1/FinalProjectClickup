# FinalProjectClickup
This is the final project of the course about software documentation with [Jordan Stanchev](https://github.com/JordanStanchev/Getting-Started-as-User-Assistance-Developer). 

Topic
I chose to document Clickup, in particular the form building function.

Target audience form builder feature
My target audience are users like me: such a user would use for business and/or private to organize time and resources adn plan goals and projects on a more or less granular level. The user is computer literate and wants to understand workflows and automations.

Target audience API endpoints for building testimonials on website
web developer

Feature documentation
The form builder feature in Clickup creates a form, called a form view, that can be shared and embedded. If the form is submitted a task is created tht contains the specified fields and data.

API documentation
Endpoints for getting data from tasks depending on status will be addressed. As an example, the form data from the earlier built form will be queried and used to build a testimonial on the website.

The API documentation was created on Swagger and pushed to the docs in this project.
The example code for the API documentation is in this repo.

The documentation of the form builder feature and API live on the Wiki page of this project.
