# FinalProjectClickup
This is the final project of the course about software documentation with [Jordan Stanchev](https://github.com/JordanStanchev/Getting-Started-as-User-Assistance-Developer). I chose to document Clickup, in particular the form building function. 

My target audience are users like me: such a user would use for business and/or private to organize time and resources adn plan goals and projects on a more or less granular level. The user is computer literate and wants to understand workflows and automations.  

The documentation lives on the Wiki page.
